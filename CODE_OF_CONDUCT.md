# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of FlowPath open source software, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by
posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other
activities.

Communication through any of the FlowPath channels (GitHub, Gitter, Slack, IRC, mailing lists,
Google+, Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public
or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender,
gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of
experience. We expect anyone contributing to the FlowPath open source project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the FlowPath open source
project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed
appropriate.
